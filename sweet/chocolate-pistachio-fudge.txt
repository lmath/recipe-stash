https://www.nigella.com/recipes/chocolate-pistachio-fudge

INGREDIENTS
Makes: 64 pieces of rich fudge

350 grams dark chocolate (chopped, minimum 70% cocoa solids)
1 x 397 grams can condensed milk
30 grams butter
pinch of salt
150 grams pistachios

METHOD
1. Put the chopped chocolate, condensed milk, butter and salt in a heavy-based pan on a low heat, and stir to melt.
2. Put the nuts into a freezer bag and bash them with a rolling pin, until broken up into both big and little pieces.
3. Add the nuts to the melted chocolate and condensed milk and stir well to mix.
4. Pour and spatch this mixture into a foil tray 23cm / 9 inch square, smoothing the top.
5. Let the fudge cool, and refrigerate until set. You can then cut it into small pieces approx. 3 x 2.25cm / 1¾ x 1¾ inches. Cutting 8 x 10 / 7 x 7 lines in the tin to give 64 pieces best achieves this.
Once cut, it can be kept in the freezer - no need to thaw just eat straight away.
