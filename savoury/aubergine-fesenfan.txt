Serves 4 as a main course 

120g walnuts
4 medium aubergines (1.2 kg) 
Rapeseed oil 
Salt and ground black pepper
2 large red onions, thinly sliced 
2 cloves of garlic, crushed 
1½ tablespoons honey 
¾ teaspoon chilli powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses
250ml hot vegetable stock
Seeds from 1 pomegranate (see page 289 for how to deseed) 
A handful of fresh coriander

Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6 and line a large baking tray with lightly oiled foil. Blitz the walnuts in a food processor to a fine crumb and leave to one side. 

Cut the aubergines into 5cm x 2cm batons, toss with oil, season lightly with salt and black pepper, and roast on the baking tray for 25 minutes or until meltingly soft. 

While the aubergines are roasting, make the fesenjan sauce. Put 3 tablespoons of oil into a large frying pan over a medium heat and, when hot, add the red onions. Fry for 12 minutes, stirring regularly to ensure they don’t burn, then add the garlic and fry for a further 3 minutes. 

Add the honey, chilli powder, cinnamon, ½ teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, the blitzed walnuts and the pomegranate molasses to the pan, and stir thoroughly to mix. Then add the vegetable stock and cook for around 8 minutes, until the sauce comes together. 

When the aubergines are tender, pour the sauce into a serving dish. Put the aubergines on top, and scatter with the pomegranate seeds and coriander. Serve alongside steamed basmati rice.
