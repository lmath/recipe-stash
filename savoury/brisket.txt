Shaun's brisket recipe

Written for my mate who absolutely cannot cook whatsoever:
Massive beef brisket (morrisons is pretty good- get the biggest they have, with a decent layer of fat on one side)
Heat a glug of oil in a big casserole or pot and turn the brisket in the hot oil to brown the outside a bit.
After it's mostly browned on the outside, chuck 2 large sliced onions into the pot and cook over a low heat so that they soften without colouring.
Spread a thick layer of English mustard all over the fatty side of the brisket.
Lay the brisket on a layer of the softened onions. Chuck a handful of Rosemary sprigs and a bulbs worth of garlic cloves (smoked ones if they have it) in the pot. Add another glug of olive oil over the whole lot and then cover it tightly.
Cook for about 5 hours at 170degrees.

After it's cooked, lift the brisket out the pot but leave the onions etc in. Set the pot on a low heat, add 2/3 of a pint of water and scrape the burnt juicy shit off the bottom to make a light gravy.
Stir in a tablespoon of blackcurrant jam and a tablespoon of flour. Simmer it until it thickens to a deep, dark, rich gravy. 
Shred the brisket with two forks (it should be extremely tender) and serve with the strained gravy poured over it. 
Rolls with sliced cheese and lettuce are a decent brisket vehicle. Mustard too, or blue cheese.

Shopping list: Massive beef brisket (morrisons is pretty good- get the biggest they have, with a decent layer of fat on one side), 2 large onions, English mustard, rosemary sprigs, bulb of garlic. Jam.
